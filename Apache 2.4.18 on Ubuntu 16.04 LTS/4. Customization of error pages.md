## 4. Customization of error pages | Step-by-step

 * Prerequisites. 
   * [Apache Server 2.4.18 Installation](https://github.com/ddufale/Network-Services-Management/blob/master/Apache%202.4.18%20on%20Ubuntu%2016.04%20LTS/Install%20Apache%202.4.8.md)
   * All the directives and concepts could be read on the oficial [Apache website](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/), so that we will dispense with this knowledge trhough this step-by-step document.

When some type a url indicating some resource that could not be on the server on could cause and internal server issue there is where we need to manage these issues to not give back a response with our server information.

## So, let's get started with this capacibilitie

Apache allows the customization of error pages to circumvented the response back with crucial server information. 
In order to enable this capabilty, we just need to create some html pages to be configured as our error pages when the user type an incorrect url.
We'll configure the error pages for the third point on the task list corresponding to the domain name spotify.com, but it is the same process for eache point_x directory with its corresponding virtual hosts for web sites that we have created along this process.

  **1.** Open a terminal and type the following lines to create our sample pages to be configured. It's a good practice from my own point of view to pull apart these error pages from the current served normal pages with its own directory.
  
   * Create a directory to place the error pages within the public_html directory corresponding to the current website
   
      sudo mkdir /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/error_pages
   
   * Then, create the files you wannt to be served in case an error. We will create one file for 404 server code and second one for all 50x server code error
   
      sudo touch /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/error_pages/custom_404.html
      sudo touch /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/error_pages/custom_50x.html

_"/point_3" refers to the second task to be achieved so that we will create a individual directory for this_

  **2.** Create a test error page for each virtual container corresponding to 404 and 50X server code files we create
 
   * Type the following lines to open and add some html content to the test erros pages for cga.com container
   
  #### 404 server code file to be server
  
            sudo nano /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/error_pages/custom_404.html
            
   * HTML content to be added
            
            <html>
              <head>
                <title>Bienvenido a cerveza.com!</title>
              </head>
              <body>
                <h1 style='color:red'>Error 404: Not founds :-(</h1>
                <p>I have no idea where that file is, sorry.  Are you sure you typed in the correct URL?</p>
              </body>
            </html>
            
  #### 50x server code file to be server      
            
            sudo nano /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/error_pages/custom_40X.html
            
   * HTML content to be added
            
            <html>
              <head>
                <title>Bienvenido a cerveza.com!</title>
              </head>
              <body>
                <h1 style='color:red'>Error 404: Not founds :-(</h1>
                <p>I have no idea where that file is, sorry.  Are you sure you typed in the correct URL?</p>
              </body>
            </html>
            
  __** Do the same for the remaining directory ("spotify.com" and "escom.com") if you want, but not forget to change the content to show different pages.**__


  **3.** Edit the configuration file for each virtual host corresponding to each domain name, in this case for spotify.com
  
   * Type the following line to open the file
        
          sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/cga.com.conf 
   
   * You have the following content
          
          <VirtualHost *:81>
            ServerAdmin admin@cga.com
            ServerName cga.com
            ServerAlias www.cga.com
 
            DocumentRoot /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html

            ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/point_3/cga.com/error.log

            </FilesMatch>
            <Directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin>
                        SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
            </Directory>
            BrowserMatch "MSIE [2-6]" \
                        nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \

            BrowserMatch "MSIE [17-9]" ssl-unclean-shutdown
          </VirtualHost>
          
    * You need to have at the end the following content
          
          <VirtualHost *:81>

            ServerName cga.com

##

However, we added an additional set of configurations so that our error pages cannot be requested directly by clients. 
This can prevent some strange situations where the text of a page references an error, but the http status is "200" 
(indicating a successful request).

**Respond with 404 When Error Pages are Directly Requested**

To implement this behavior, we needed to add a <Files> block directive for each of our custom pages. Inside, we can test whether 
the REDIRECT_STATUS environmental variable is set. This should only be set when the ErrorDocument directive processes 
a request. If the environmental variable is empty, we'll serve a 404 error.

**Set Up Testing for 50X-Level Errors**

We can easily produce 404 errors to test our configuration by requesting content that doesn't exist. 
To test the 50X-level errors, we'll have to set up a dummy proxy pass so that we can ensure that the 
correct pages are returned.

Add a ProxyPass directive to the bottom of the virtual host. Send requests for /proxytest to port 9000 on the local machine (where no service is running):

  **4.** Then, you need enable the following **proxy** and **proxy_http** modules by typing on the terminal
  
              sudo a2enmod proxy
              sudo a2enmod proxy_http
        
   * Reload apache by typing the follwing
        
            sudo service apache2 reload
   
  **5.** Lastly, you only need to test with the browser entering each domain name and the corresponding port.
  
          http://server_domain_or_IP/thiswillerror.html
          http://server_domain_or_IP/proxytest
