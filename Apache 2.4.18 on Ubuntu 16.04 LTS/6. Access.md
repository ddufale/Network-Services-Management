## 6. Access | Step-by-step

* Prerequisites. 
   * [Apache Server 2.4.18 Installation](https://github.com/ddufale/Network-Services-Management/blob/master/Apache%202.4.18%20on%20Ubuntu%2016.04%20LTS/Install%20Apache%202.4.8.md)
   * All the directives and concepts could be read on the oficial [Apache website](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/), so that we will dispense with this knowledge trhough this step-by-step document.
   
   
   
   It is required to create some directories and some files to be tested for each control access.
   These ones will be achieved by typing the following lines:
   
   Directory and file for:
    
   1. By IP
   
          sudo mkdir /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/ip_denied
          sudo touch /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/ip_denied/secret.html
   
   2. By network segment
        
          sudo mkdir /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/ip_segment_denied
          sudo touch /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/ip_segment_denied/test_ip_segment.html
        
   3. By domain name (optional)
   4. By user
   
          sudo mkdir /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/user_granted
          sudo touch /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/user_granted/single_user_granted.html
    
   5. By user/password list
   
          sudo mkdir /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/users_granted
          sudo touch /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/users_granted/users_granted.html
        
        
   _**Note.** Add some content for each files._

You may want to read the oficial documentation from Apache website for [Access control](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/es/howto/access.html) or [Authorization and Authentication](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/auth.html)

Apache allows the capability to allow access on virtual hosts by different ways. Some resources within some virtual host on your
server may be restricted to those you want to be able to request. Access control goes to with different modules.

On this step-by-step serie, we will achieve the point 6 of the task list by giving access to some files on invidual directories 
on the domain name cga.com.

The next part will bring you from the following ways to restrict access:

  1. By IP
  2. By network segment
  3. By domain name (optional)
  4. By user
  5. By user/password list
  
  
  ## So, let's get started
  
  ##
  
  **1.** By IP
   
   * Open the **cga.com.conf** file from **/etc/apache2/sites-available** and add the subsequent lines within the 
   <VirtualHost> directive
   
          #IP denied configuration for file in an specific directory /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/ip_denied/secret.html
	        <Directory /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/ip_denied/>
            <Files secret.html>
              <RequireAll>
                Require all granted
                Require not ip youip_address
              </RequireAll>
            </Files>
          </Directory>
          
    * Save and exit.
    
   Visitor coming from the IP that is configured (yourip_address) will not have access to the content covered by this 
   directive.
   
   * Last, you need you disable the site from **/etc/apache2/sites-enable**, enable it and reload the server.
   
            sudo a2dissite cga.com.conf
            sudo a2ensite cga.com.conf
            sudo service apache2 reload
   
   * Then, just try to request the file from your browser on the machine with the correspoding ip address you restricted
   
   ##
   
   ##
  
  **2.** By IP segment
   
   * Open the **cga.com.conf** file from **/etc/apache2/sites-available** and add the subsequent lines within the 
   <VirtualHost> directive
   
          #IP segment denied configuration for directory /var/www/point/cga.com/public_html/ip_segment_denied/test_ip_segment.html
          <Directory /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/ip_segment_denied/>
            <Files test_ip_segment.html>
              <RequireAll>
                Require all granted
                Require not ip 192.168.1.0/24
              </RequireAll>
            </Files>
          </Directory>
          
    * Save and exit.
    
   Visitors coming from the IP segment 192.168.1.0/24 will not have access to the content covered by this directive.
   
   * Last, you need you disable the site from **/etc/apache2/sites-enable**, enable it and reload the server.
   
            sudo a2dissite cga.com.conf
            sudo a2ensite cga.com.conf
            sudo service apache2 reload
   
   * Then, just try to request the file from your browser on the machine with the correspoding ip address you restricted
   
   ##
   
   **3.** By user
   
   First, you will need to create a password file and must be in a site that can not be accessed from internal or external people. 
   So do not forget to change the permissions for this one. To create the password file, use the htpasswd utility that comes with 
   Apache.

   * To create the file type the following. htpasswd will ask you for a password, and then you will be asked to retype it to 
   confirm it.
    
          sudo htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/passwd/passwords userone
     
   At this point with this line we indicate to create the directory **/passwd** with the passwords file to hold the user 
   and password for each credentials users you want to upload within the path **/etc/apache2**.
   
   
   **Note.** To add other user just type the same previous line but without -c flag.
   
   
   Next you need to configure the server to ask for a password and tell the server which users are allowed to access. 
   for my own point of view, it is good to configure from inside your virtual host you want to restrict. I say that
   because you are able to do this by configure httpd.conf file. In this case, we will configure within the virtual host
   corresponding to the domain name you are configuring.
   
   
   * Open the **cga.com.conf** file from **/etc/apache2/sites-available** and add the subsequent lines within the 
   <VirtualHost> directive
   
          #Configuration for a especific file within a specific directory to control access for one user
          #/var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/user_granted/single_user_granted.html
          <Directory /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/user_granted/single_user_granted.html>
            <Files single_user_granted.html>
			        AuthType Basic
			        AuthName "Restricted Files by one user"
			        AuthBasicProvider file
			        AuthUserFile "/etc/apache2/passwd/passwords"
			        Require user aleruiz
            </Files>
          </Directory>
          
    * Save and exit.
    
   Visitors define on **/etc/apache2/passwd/passwords** just will be access with their corresponding passwords. In this case
   you just create one user.
   
   * Next, you need to enable the group authorization module from **/etc/apache2/mods-available**, enable it and restart 
   the server by the following line.
   
   	    sudo a2enmod authz_groupfile
	    sudo service apache2 restart
   
   * Last, you need disable the site from **/etc/apache2/sites-enable**, enable it and reload the server.
   
            sudo a2dissite cga.com.conf
            sudo a2ensite cga.com.conf
            sudo service apache2 reload
   
   * Then, just try to request the file from your browser, you will be prompted with user and pass fields to be filled with 
   the rights.
   
   **Note.** If you cancel this prompt you may get a error page response, this is where you take advantage of error pages
   for the correct server code you configured or you need to configure.
   
   ##
   
   ##
   
   **4.** By user/password list
   
   If you want to allow more than one person access, you will need to create a group file that associates group names with 
   people names to allow them access. The format of this file is quite simple, and you can create it with your favorite text 
   editor. The contents of the file will look like:
   
          GroupName: userone usertwo userthree userfour
          
   We will created this file into /etc/apache2/passwd with the name **groups**.
   
   Need, you need to add other users to be able to access some restricted resources.
     
   * At this point you already have one user so you need to add some others typing the next line defining his nickname:
   
            sudo htpasswd /etc/apache2/passwd/passwords userx
   
   * Save and exit.
   
   * Then, Open the **cga.com.conf** file from **/etc/apache2/sites-available** and add the subsequent lines within the 
   <VirtualHost> directive
   
          #configuration for directory to control access for more than one user
          #/var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/users_granted/users_granted.html
          <Directory /var/www/point_3/cga.com/public_html/users_granted/>
            <Files users_granted.html>
			        AuthType Basic
			        AuthName "Restricted Files by Group"
			        AuthBasicProvider file
			        AuthUserFile "/etc/apache2/passwd/passwords"
			        AuthGroupFile "/etc/apache2/passwd/groups"
			        Require group leaders
            </Files>
          </Directory>
          
    * Save and exit.
    
   Visitors define on **/etc/apache2/passwd/passwords** related to the group **leaders** just will be access with their 
   corresponding passwords.
   
   * Last, you need you disable the site from **/etc/apache2/sites-enable**, enable it and reload the server.
   
            sudo a2dissite cga.com.conf
            sudo a2ensite cga.com.conf
            sudo service apache2 reload
   
   * Then, just try to request the file from your browser, you will be prompted with user and pass fields to be filled with 
   the rights.
   
   **Note.** If you cancel this prompt you may get a error page response, this is where you take advantage of error pages
   for the correct server code you configured or you need to configure.
